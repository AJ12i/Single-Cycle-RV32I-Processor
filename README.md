# Single Cycle RV32I Processor
Developed a Single Cycle RISC-V Processor in SystemVerilog

## üìú Overview  
This repository contains the SystemVerilog implementation of a Single Cycle RISC-V processor architecture. The design incorporates all the basic instruction types in the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).

Through a modular design approach i.e each element in the design has a separate RTL module along with a dedicated testbench the overall working of the processor has been verified.
